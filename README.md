<h1>OFA Scraper</h1>
A ruby scraper to collect data on investors and entrepreneurs 👔✔️📝

Ruby version 2.6.3

The goal of this project was to quickly create a tool to scrape data from OFA. It was important that the finished software produced a clean csv file for use in Microsoft Excel 💪

I'm still very new to coding and appreciate any feedback you might have 😇
